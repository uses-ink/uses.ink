## You got a GitHub repo ? You got a blog !

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named [`blog`](github.com/new?name=blog)
2. Create a new file in the repository named `README.md` on branch `main`
3. Visit `<user>.uses.ink` to see your blog !

### My blog is not in a repository named `blog`

You can specify the repository name in the URL like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>`

### The files are not in the root of the repository

The current path can be specified in the URL after the repository name like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>/<path>`

### I am not using the `main` branch

The branch is specified in the URL with the `@` symbol like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>@<branch>`
