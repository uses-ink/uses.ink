This is a minimalistic blog platform for developers. It's based on markdown files and uses GitHub as a storage.

> [!NOTE]
> A rewrite of this project with [`astro`](https://astro.build) is in progress. The legacy version will be kept in the [`legacy`](https://github.com/uses-ink/uses.ink/tree/legacy) branch.

## Self-hosting

You can easily self-host this platform with Docker. Start by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT touch `.env.production` as it is used as a template for the production environment.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `REDIS_URL` value may seem a bit confusing (`redis://redis:6379`). This is because docker compose automatically creates a network for the services and uses the service name as the hostname. This is why we can use `redis` as the hostname.

Then, run the following command to start the platform:

```bash
docker compose --profile prod up -d
```

You can now access the platform at [`http://localhost:8765`](http://localhost:8765).

In case you want to use the latest commit from the repository, you can build the image locally with the `dev` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up -d
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When stopping the platform, make sure to stop the containers with the appropriate profile:
> ```bash
> docker compose --profile prod down # or --profile dev
> ```
> In case you're having trouble recreating the containers, use the `--force-recreate` flag.


## Development

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager. It is needed to properly install and patch the dependencies (See [Patches](#patches)).

Make sure to have a `redis` server running somewhere. You can use the following command to quicly spin up a redis server with docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Populate the `.env` file with the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` for development. The platform will work without it.

To start the development server, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

## Miscellaneous dependencies

### Patches
This project uses a patched version of [`hast-util-sanitize@5.0.1`](patches/hast-util-sanitize@5.0.1.patch) to allow unknown nodes to be processed through an `unknownNodeHandler` function. We need this to allow plugins such as [`remark-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) to pass declarations.

### d2wasm

> [!NOTE]
> This section is currently not relevant because the platform uses the `d2` CLI due to the poor performance of the wasm module. Documentation is kept for future reference. 

This project uses [`d2`](https://d2lang.com) to render diagrams. The diagrams are rendered using WebAssembly on the server. The module comes from the [`d2wasm`](https://github.com/uses-ink/d2wasm) repository. It can be found in the [`wasm`](wasm/) directory.

To update the wasm module, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm update-d2wasm
```

This will grab the latest version of the wasm module and place it in its appropriate directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/uses-ink/uses.ink/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/uses-ink/uses.ink/pulls).

I am currently looking for help with the following:

- [ ] Improve the [`d2wasm`](https://github.com/uses-ink/d2wasm) WebAssembly module performance / size.
